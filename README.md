# Extrahop
this is all my collection of Extrahop bundles & triggers

when this was written it works like a charm, but as time flies, it might need a slight adjustment to new environments, since the trigger API are always getting updates as the firmware updates/upgrade released
so I don't have any guarantee if this bundles works in your environment or not. you just have to try it, and adjust it along the way, and might even have to debug it.

I'm not a developer. so it's understandable if my coding isn't as tidy as a developer would/should.
